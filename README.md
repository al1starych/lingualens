# LinguaLens

LinguaLens is an innovative language learning tool that leverages the Birkenbihl Method to help users decode and master foreign languages effectively. By breaking down sentences into word-by-word translations and providing fluent, natural translations alongside grammar explanations, LinguaLens makes language learning intuitive and engaging. Built with a Flask backend and a responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, this project is perfect for language enthusiasts, learners, and developers interested in educational technology.
